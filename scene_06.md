## Foodcritic - Intro

Programming languages give you many ways to solve your problems. The domain-specific languages built  that help you define attributes, recipes, and libraries are simply helper methods on top of Ruby. So when it comes time to composing cookbook code you often have many ways to solve the problem.

In this section we are going to use Foodcritic, a linting tool, to evalute our cookbooks. Foodcritic assists us by evaluating our code and giving us feedback. This feedback shows us where our code violates chef community coventions.

This tool is build specifically to evaluate cookbooks and enforces the standards defined by the community of individuals working with the Foodcritic project or the custom rules that you define.
