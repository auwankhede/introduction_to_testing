# Test-Driven Development

This is the outline for an online, recorded workshop. Each scene represents another video that would be recorded and delivered to the individual taking the course.

Each scene is a markdown script (scene file). Each scene will have an accompanying slides (etc. pdf, keynote, powerpoint).

Each scene is deliverable. Allowing for the development and refinement of scenes while the others may still need the initial script or slides.

Please refer to the [issues](https://github.com/learnchef/test_driven_development/issues) to figure out what sections could use your attention. 

* Edit the scene text - A lot of the early scenes have had at least a second review but could benefit from more edits. The later scenes are less refined and still needing more major reworking (e.g. Scene 10 on ChefSpec and ServerSpec).

* Writing the slides - The early scenes need slides before they are ready to be recorded. So if you want to create these section that would be helpful.

* Write a scene - All of the exercise scenes have not been created. There are slides from the slide deck for those that could need words written for them. However, I think most of the exercises are going to need a little more work.
