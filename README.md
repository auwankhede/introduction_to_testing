## Introductions

The purpose of introductions is two-fold.

First to get to know the audience. Try to assess interests, skill level, and motivation for learning Chef so you can later maintain a consistent level of engagement.

Second to allow for the attendees to become more comfortable with the individuals that also participating in the workshop. Attendees in the workshop often share similar motivations and skill levels so it this is a great opportunity to start to foster a sense of a cohert. Allowing each of the attendees to feel comfortable asking each other questions and assistance.
