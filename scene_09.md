Foodcritic - Summary

* What are the advantages of Foodcritic?

Foodcritic dishes out cookbook related convention violations that expose areas where the cookbook may be using components incorrectly or ways that may make them incompatible in alternate environments.

* How can you tell Foodcritic to exclude specific tests?

You can use the -t flag to define which specific violation or tagged set of violations to run. You can exclude either a violation or tagged set of violations simply by prefixing it with a tilde character (~).  You may also set default rules inside a .foodcritic file
